## Pacman (Live Session)

To use `pacman` or a browser in the live session, you need a working network connection.

- **Wired (Ethernet)** connections work automatically.
- **Wireless** connections can be configured via the network icon on the panel:
  - Left-click the icon
  - Select your network from the list
  - Enter your Wi-Fi password

---

## Installation Tips and Tricks

If your live session runs out of disk space, you can remount the live filesystem with more space:

```
sudo mount -o remount,size=8G /run/archiso/cowspace
```

## Intel Graphics on ArchBang

ArchBang does **not** include the legacy `xf86-video-intel` driver by default.

On most Intel systems (Sandy Bridge / 2011 and newer), Xorg will use the built-in *modesetting* driver (via Mesa), which is generally the best option.

---

### Quick fix (older Intel iGPUs)

If you see poor performance, tearing in Xorg, or a black screen on very old Intel hardware, install the legacy driver and reboot:

```bash
sudo pacman -S xf86-video-intel
```

---

## Installation

To begin installation:

1. Right-click on the desktop
2. Select **Install** from the main menu

The installer is menu-driven and easy to follow.

> Need help with partitions?
> Use **GParted**, available via the Openbox menu under **Settings**.

---

## Post-Install Steps

### Microcode Notice

ArchBANG includes **both** `intel-ucode` and `amd-ucode` microcode packages to support a wide range of CPUs.

You only need **one**, depending on your processor.

> **Important:**
> If you remove a microcode package **after installation**, and your bootloader references it, your system **may fail to boot**.
> Only remove the unused one if you are comfortable editing your bootloader entries.

> After removal, update your bootloader configuration to reflect the change (e.g., regenerate GRUB or edit `loader.conf` if using systemd-boot).

---

### Ensure You Have a Network Connection

Refer to the instructions in the **Pacman Live** section above if needed.

### Initialize Pacman

`pacman` will not work until keys are initialized. Run the following:

```
ab-pacman-keys
```

This will:

- Create keys
- Refresh the package cache
- Update the `archlinux-keyring`

---

### Basic Package Usage

Search for packages:

```bash
sudo pacman -Ss <package-name>
```

Install a package:

```bash
sudo pacman -S <package-name>
```
